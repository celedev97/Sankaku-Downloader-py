# Sankaku-Downloader

A downloader for SankakuComplex images written in python.

## Running the program

To use the program simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/fc-dev/Sankaku-Downloader/releases/latest) for your operating system and run it.

### Prerequisites

To run the program directly from source you need python (3.7.4) installed, but if you download a release it's already bundled with python so you don't need to download it.
