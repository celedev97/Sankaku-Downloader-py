# Sankaku-Downloader

A downloader for SankakuComplex images written in python.

## Getting Started

To use the program simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/fc-dev/Sankaku-Downloader/releases/latest) for your operating system and run it.

### Prerequisites

Depending on your operating system you may need python (3.7.4) installed.

For now the only release is for windows and it's already bundled with python so you don't need to download it.

### Installing

The program is a standalone and doesn't require installation.
